# MyVectorImplementation

Welcome to the MyVectorImplementation repository! This repository contains a C++ header file named `MyVectorImplementation.h`, which provides an implementation of vectors in C++.

## Description
The `MyVectorImplementation.h` file contains a custom implementation of vectors, a dynamic array-like data structure, in C++. Vectors are commonly used in C++ for storing and manipulating sequences of elements dynamically.

### Features
- Dynamic resizing: The vector automatically adjusts its size to accommodate the elements added to it.
- Access methods: Provides methods for accessing elements at specific indices, adding elements, removing elements, and more.
- Memory management: Handles memory allocation and deallocation internally to ensure efficient usage of memory.
- Generic: Can store elements of any data type.

## Usage
To use the `MyVectorImplementation.h` file in your C++ projects, simply include it in your source code:

```cpp
#include "MyVectorImplementation.h"
```

Then, you can create instances of the `MyVector` class and use its methods to work with vectors:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "MyVectorImplementation.h"

int main() {
    // Create a vector of integers
    MyVector<int> myVector;

    // Add elements to the vector
    myVector.push_back(1);
    myVector.push_back(2);
    myVector.push_back(3);

    // Print the elements of the vector
    for (int i = 0; i < myVector.size(); ++i) {
        std::cout << myVector[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
